  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Creating a new project">
    1. Open your favorite code editor
    2. Create a new folder
    3. Run `npm init`/`yarn init`/`pnpm init` to initialize a package.json
    4. Run `npm install yor.ts@latest`/`yarn add yor.ts@latest`/`pnpm install yor.ts@latest` to install yor.ts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Downloading cloudflare workers cli">
    1. Run `npm install -g wrangler`/`yarn global add wrangler`/`pnpm add -g wrangler` to install the cli
    2. Run `wrangler login` to login to your cloudflare account
    3. Run `wrangler init` to create a new project

    4. Put the following in `wrangler.toml`:
    ```toml
    name = "interactions"
    main = "./dist/index.js"
    node_compat = true
    compatibility_date = "2023-10-22"

    vars = {
      DISCORD_APP_ID = "CLIENT_ID"
      DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "BOT_TOKEN"
      DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY = "PUBLIC_KEY"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creating src/index.ts">
    1. Add the following to `src/index.ts`:
    ```ts
    import { CommandContext, YorClient, YorSlashCommand } from "yor.ts";
    import { SlashCommandBuilder } from "yor.ts/builders";
    
    export interface Env {
        DISCORD_APP_ID: string;
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: string;
        DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY: string;
    }

    class PingCommand extends YorSlashCommand {
        public builder = new SlashCommandBuilder()
            .setName("ping")
            .setDescription("Replies with Pong!");

        public execute = (context: CommandContext) => {
            context.reply("Pong!");
        }
    }

    export default {
        fetch: async (request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
            const client = new YorClient({
                application: {
                    id: env.DISCORD_APP_ID,
                    publicKey: env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
                },
                token: env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
            });

            const command = new PingCommand();
            client.registerCommand(command);

            const response = await yor.handleRequest(request, env, ctx);

            return new Response(JSON.stringify(response), {
                headers: {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                }
            });
        }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the project">
    1. Run `wrangler deploy` to deploy your project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing the bot">
    1. Pick the URL from the wrangler logs
    2. Open the URL in your browser
    3. Go to the discord developer portal and add the URL and submit it as interactions endpoint
  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing to see if it works">
    1. Open discord server you invited your bot into
